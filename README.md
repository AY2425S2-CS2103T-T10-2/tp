## CS2103T Project Information

- The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
